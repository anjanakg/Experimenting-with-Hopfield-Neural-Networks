# Experimenting with Hopfield Neural Networks

<p align="justify"> Hopfield is a Recurrent Neural Network. The Hopfield model has two stages as storage and retrieval. The weights are calculated based on the stored states and the weights are not updated during iterations. Hopfield networks store states with minimum energy. One of their applications is image recognition.

Here I added 3 notebooks. 


[Hopfield NN Finding possible Final States of a Vector](HopfieldNN_Finding_possible_Final_States_of_a_Vector.ipynb) 

<p align="justify">In this assignment, I simulated Hopfield Network as an Associative memory, Asynchronized mode, and updated one neuron at a time. I stored 2 vectors as memories. Then I used all possible initial states to find the final (stable) states. And then I plotted the initial state decimal vs. the final state decimal.

[Hopfield NN with Single Image Pattern](HopfieldNN_with_single_image_pattern.ipynb) 
<p align="justify">Here I used one of my pictures. I turned it to binary, added distortion to the image, and then simulated the Hopfield NN to fix it.
